# BankMarketing
Optimized bank marketing response model without 'duration' to cut telemarketing costs. Used logistic regression to target top prospects, achieving 80% responders at minimal cost. Delivered R script for modeling, cost analysis, and a lift chart comparing model-driven vs. baseline response rates

**Bank Marketing Response Model Optimization**
Project Overview
This project builds an optimized response model to target bank marketing prospects without using the variable 'duration' (call duration in seconds), which significantly impacts telemarketing costs. The objective is to maximize the number of responders while minimizing telemarketing expenses by identifying top prospects likely to respond.

Objective

Response Prediction: Develop a logistic regression model excluding 'duration' to predict response likelihood, identifying variables that correlate with response.
Cost Optimization: Determine the optimal number of top prospects to target to achieve 80% of total responders at the lowest cost using a variable call cost function.
Deliverables

R Script: Complete code for data preparation, model building, cost analysis, and prospect targeting, with comments for key metrics.
Lift Chart: Visualization comparing model-based response rates with baseline response rates.
Technologies Used

R: For data processing, logistic regression modeling, and cost calculation.
Predictive Analytics: To achieve efficient targeting and cost-effectiveness in telemarketing.
